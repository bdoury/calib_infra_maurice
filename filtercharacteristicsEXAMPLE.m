%   filtercharact.designname: filter design (ex. 'butter')
%   filtercharact.Norder: order of the filter
%   filtercharact.Wlow_Hz:
%   filtercharact.Whigh_Hz:
%   filtercharact.SCPperiod_sec: duration in second
%                 over which SPC is performed,
%                 expected as stationarity time
%   filtercharact.windowshape: window shape for spectral
