1) to extract data from database run:
                - RUNextractfromDB.m
   after providing the settings. 
   This program makes requests at the database and save the records into 
   a selected directory (here '../../../AAdataI26calib/'). The records 
   consists of data, name of the channel, etc
   This directory is partitioned in 8 directories from s1 to s8.
   The program uses the programs extractfromDB.m, convertCSSmatlab.m
   and savesignals.m, located in ZZtoolbox/00pierrick/

2) to analyze the signals run:
                - estimationwithFB.m
   is used  from the selected directory 
   (here '../../../AAdataI26calib/'). A few part of the results is saved 
   in a selected directory as  'AAresultswithFB98_5'
   with one file by sensor location
   The program uses the functions fbankanalysis.m and statsRatioHbis.m
   located in ZZtoolbox/.

3) programs in the directory progs2display allow to display some results.
 
Rk: AAresultswithFB98 and AAresultswithFB9810 are respectively for filtercharact(1).ratioDFT2SCP
equals 5 and 10. They shoud give about the same results.
